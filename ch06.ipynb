A queue is similar to a stack that we looked at in previous chapters to understand how recursive functions are handled behind the scenes-- items are stored one on top of another and we are not able to access a random element in the data structure.  However, unlike a stack, which operates using LIFO (last in, first out), a queue works on FIFO (first in, first out).  "
